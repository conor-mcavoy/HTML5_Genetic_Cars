# BoxCar2D2

A genetic algorithm experiment. Forked from [here](https://github.com/red42/HTML5_Genetic_Cars), which itself was originally based on a now defunct project called [BoxCar2D](http://boxcar2d.com/).

I forked this in order to add some features that the original BoxCar2D had, plus some other features that I want. I am very thankful to [Rafael Matsunaga](https://rednuht.org/) and everyone else who contributed code.

# Features

An inexhaustive list of some features I wish to add.

* Car editor
* Deterministic simulation
* Customizable terrain generation
* Different terrain types
* UI changes
